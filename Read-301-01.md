# Component 


## What is a Component?
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality
that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.




## What are the characteristics of a component?
Reusable − Components usually designed to  be reused in different situations in different applications or to do spacifec task.
Replaceable − they can be substituted with other similar components.
Not context specific − they can operate in different environments and contexts.
Extensible − they can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
Encapsulated − they have interfaces that allow the caller to use its functionality without exposing any internal details.
Independent − they are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

## What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

1.Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

2.Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

3.Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

4.Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

5.Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

6.Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

7.System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

8.Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

#Props In React
## What is Props?
-React is a component-based library that divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props.
“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

### Using Props in React

I will be explaining how to use Props step by step.

    Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
    Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
    Finally, render the Props Data
    #### Exampel

  What is the flow of props?
  `
  ParentComponent including another component (child):

class ParentComponent extends Component {  
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>
        I'm the parent component.
        <ChildComponent />
      </h1>
    );
  }
}
  `
  `
  ChildComponent:

const ChildComponent = () => {  
  return <p>I'm the 1st child!</p>; 
};
`
`we can do the same for React components. We can define our own attributes & assign values with interpolation { }:

<ChildComponent someAttribute={value} anotherAttribute={value}/>`
