 ## Chapter 19 ...>Practical Information

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
1.The Basics
Search engine optimization (or 
SEO) is the practice of trying 
to help your site appear nearer 
the top of search engine results 
when people look for the topics 
that your website covers.
2.On-Page Techniques
On-page techniques are the 
methods you can use on your 
web pages to improve their 
rating in search engines.
3.Off-Page Techniques
Getting other sites to link to you 
is just as important as on-page 
techniques. Search engines help 
determine how to rank your 
site by looking at the number of 
other sites that link to yours

### Analytics: Learning about your Visitors
1.Signing Up
The Google Analytics service 
relies on you signing up for an 
account at:
``www.google.com/analytics`
The site will give you a piece of 
tracking code which you need to 
put on every page of your site.
2.How it Works
Every time someone loads a 
page of your site, the tracking 
code sends data to the Google 
servers where it is stored. 
Google then provides a webbased interface that allows you 
to see how visitors use your site.
3.The Tracking Code
A tracking code is provided 
by Google Analytics for each 
website you are tracking. It 
should appear just before the 
closing `</head>` tag. The code 
does not alter the appearance of 
your web pages
