### Structuring Word Documents
>The use of headings and 
subheadings in any document 
often reflects a hierarchy of 
>information

### HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages
>
Let's look closer at the code from the last page. 
There are several different elements. Each 
element has an opening tag and a closing tag.
Tags act like containers. They tell you 
something about the information that lies 
between their opening and closing tags.
>
*example
- The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code

#### tage have two part 
* Opening Tag
The characters in the brackets 
indicate the tag's purpose. 
For example, in the tags above 
the p stands for paragraph.
The closing tag has a forward 
slash after the the < symbol

  - left-angle bracket
  - Character
  - RIGHT-angle bracket
* Closing Tag
>The terms "tag" and "element" 
 are often used interchangeably.
>Strictly speaking, however, an 
 element comprises the opening 
>tag and the closing tag and any 
>content that lies between them

  - left-angle bracket
  - Forward slash
  - Character
  - RIGHT-angle bracket

### Attributes Tell Us More About Elements
>Attributes provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of two parts: a name and a value, 
>separated by an equals sign
>
The attribute name indicates 
what kind of extra information 
you are supplying about the 
element's content. It should be 
written in lowercase.
The value is the information 
or setting for the attribute. It 
should be placed in double 
quotes. Different attributes can 
have different values.
Here an attribute called lang is 
used to indicate the language 
used in this element. The value 
of this attribute on this page

## Body, Head & Titl

### body
>You met the <body> element 
in the first example we created. 
Everything inside this element is 
shown inside the main browser 
window
>
### head
>Before the <body> element you 
will often see a <head> element. 
This contains information 
about the page (rather than 
information that is shown within 
the main part of the browser 
window that is highlighted in 
blue on the opposite page). 
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
>element

### Title 
The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the 
top of the browser, above where 
you usually type in the URL of 
the page you want to visit, or 
on the tab for that page (if your 
browser uses tabs to allow you 
to view multiple pages at the same time


### Why Need Form 
 The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect


### DOCTYPE
>The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect
>

### Comments in HTML
> <!-->

## there 4 Way to select element in html 

1- ID selector (use for uniqe element )
2- class selector (use for group element)
3- Element selector (use for  select spacific type element )
4- Uneversal selector( use to select all elemnt in page )

### Block Elements
>
Some elements will always 
appear to start on a new line in 
the browser window. These are 
known as block level elements.
>


### Inline Element
>
Some elements will always 
appear to continue on the 
same line as their neighbouring 
elements. These are known as 
inline elements
>


### Information About Your Pages
The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.




# JavaScript

### what is a script and how do i create one 
>
A script is a series of instructions that the computer 
can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of 
all the instructions. 
Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer 
solve the task prggrammatically. 
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

### OBJECTS & PROPERTIES 
>If you could not see the picture of the hotel and cars, the data in the 
information boxes alone would still tell you a lot about this scene. 
OBJECTS (TH INGS) 
In computer programming, each physical thing in 
the world can be represented as an object. There are 
two different types of objects here: a hotel and a car. 
Programmers might say that there is one instance of 
the hotel object, and two instances of the car object. 
Each object can have its own: 
- • Properties 
- • Events 
- • Methods 
Together they create a working model of that object. 
PROPERTIES (CHARACTERISTICS) 
Both of the cars share common characteristics. 
In fact, all cars have a make, a color, and engine 
size. You could even determine their current 
speed. Programmers call these characteristics the 
properties of an object. 
Each property has a name and a value, and each of 
these name/value pairs tells you something about 
>each individual instance of the object.


### METHODS 
>Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can 
retrieve or update the values of an object's properties. 
WHAT IS A METHOD? 
Methods typically represent how people (or other 
things) interact with an object in the real world. 
They are like questions and instructions that: 
• Tell you something about that object (using 
information stored in its properties) 
• Change the value of one or more of that object's 
properties 
@ THE ABC OF PROGRAMMING 
WHAT DOES A METHOD DO? 
The code for a method can contain lots of 
instructions that together represent one task. 
When you use a method, you do not always need to 
know how it achieves its task; you just need to know 
how to ask the question and how to interpret any 
>answers it gives you
