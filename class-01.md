### Structuring Word Documents
>The use of headings and 
subheadings in any document 
often reflects a hierarchy of 
>information

### HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages
>
Let's look closer at the code from the last page. 
There are several different elements. Each 
element has an opening tag and a closing tag.
Tags act like containers. They tell you 
something about the information that lies 
between their opening and closing tags.
>
*example
- The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code

#### tage have two part 
* Opening Tag
The characters in the brackets 
indicate the tag's purpose. 
For example, in the tags above 
the p stands for paragraph.
The closing tag has a forward 
slash after the the < symbol

  - left-angle bracket
  - Character
  - RIGHT-angle bracket
* Closing Tag
>The terms "tag" and "element" 
 are often used interchangeably.
>Strictly speaking, however, an 
 element comprises the opening 
>tag and the closing tag and any 
>content that lies between them

  - left-angle bracket
  - Forward slash
  - Character
  - RIGHT-angle bracket

### Attributes Tell Us More About Elements
>Attributes provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of two parts: a name and a value, 
>separated by an equals sign
>
The attribute name indicates 
what kind of extra information 
you are supplying about the 
element's content. It should be 
written in lowercase.
The value is the information 
or setting for the attribute. It 
should be placed in double 
quotes. Different attributes can 
have different values.
Here an attribute called lang is 
used to indicate the language 
used in this element. The value 
of this attribute on this page

## Body, Head & Titl

### body
>You met the <body> element 
in the first example we created. 
Everything inside this element is 
shown inside the main browser 
window
>
### head
>Before the <body> element you 
will often see a <head> element. 
This contains information 
about the page (rather than 
information that is shown within 
the main part of the browser 
window that is highlighted in 
blue on the opposite page). 
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
>element

### Title 
The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the 
top of the browser, above where 
you usually type in the URL of 
the page you want to visit, or 
on the tab for that page (if your 
browser uses tabs to allow you 
to view multiple pages at the same time
