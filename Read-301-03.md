# lists and keys

##  List Component

````
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li>{number}</li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

# Key

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li key={number.toString()}>
    {number}
  </li>
);
```
The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:
```  
const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
  <li key={todo.id}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
```

## 1.What does .map() return?
- It returns a new array and elements of arrays are result of callback function.
## 2.If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
-Use .map()  to iterate an array displays the array values 
-And Create an array that but  the output of .map().
-Render the new  array.
## 3.Each list item needs a unique  
-unique identifier

## 4.What is the purpose of a key?
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:

# The Spread Operator

The spread operator was added to JavaScript in ES6 (ES2015), just like the rest parameters, which have the same syntax: three magic
## What is the spread operator?
-allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.
## List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
-Use Math functions
-Copy  array
-Combin objects
-Add to state in React



## Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
``
let arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5];
let arr2 = [6,7,8,9,10];
let arr1_2 = [...arr1,...arr2];
console.log(arr1_2);
``
## Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
``
let arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5];
let element = 'hi';
let array = [...array1, element];
console.log(array_i);
``

## 1.In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

1. Pass functions — don’t invoke them
You can write callback functions entirely inside the function that needs them — but for ease of readability and debugging it often helps to declare or assign them elsewhere and reference them by function or variable name.
The first thing to watch out for is that you are actually referencing them by name — not invoking them. This is the difference between writing myFunction (returns a function) and myFunction() (executes it)

## 2.In your own words, what does the increment function do?
It increments the count for the person when the person's Add button is being clicked.
## 3.How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
## 4.How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
