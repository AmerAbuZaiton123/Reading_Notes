# Thinking in React
## Start With A Mock
-The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names.
## Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
-The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names.
-Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle
-displaying a JSON data model to a user, you’ll find that if your model was built correctly, your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely. That’s because UI and data models tend to adhere to the same information architecture. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.
## Step 2: Build A Static Version in React
-building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why.
-build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of state
-For static versions, props are a way  passing data from the parent to the child.
## Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
-UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state.
-To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Figure out the absolute minimal
## Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live
- React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own 
-#For each piece of state in your application:

1-Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
2-Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
3-Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.

### How would you break a mock into a component hierarchy?
 drawing boxes for every component and sub-component and giving him  names.

### What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
 that deciding if  new function/object/component should be created based on the number of things 

### What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
 means building  version of  application that take the data model and render but has no interactivity.
