>By default, browsers rarely treat 
>the content of these elements 
>any differently than other 
>elements however designers 
>often use CSS styles to change

  # color
  #### color for text  
 -rgb values
These express colors in terms 
of how much red, green and 
blue are used to make it up. For 
example: rgb(100,100,90)

  -hex codes
These are six-digit codes that 
represent the amount of red, 
green and blue in a color, 
preceded by a pound or hash # 
sign. For example: #ee3e80
 
  -color names
There are 147 predefined color 
names that are recognized 
by browsers. For example: 
DarkCyan
We look at these three different 
ways of specifying colors on the 
next double-page spread.
  
  
### Background Color background-color
>CSS treats each HTML element 
>as if it appears in a box, and the 
>background-color property 
>sets the color of the background 
>for that box

  ### Opacity
  >CSS3 introduces the opacity
>property which allows you to 
>specify the opacity of an element 
>and any of its child elements. 
>The value is a number between 
>0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
>is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% 
>opacity).
  
  
  ### Typeface Terminology
  Serif 
Serif fonts have extra details on 
the ends of the main strokes of 
the letters. These details are 
known as serifs.
In print, serif fonts were 
traditionally used for long 
passages of text because they 
were considered easier to read.
Sans-Serif
Sans-serif fonts have straight 
ends to letters, and therefore 
have a much cleaner design.
Screens have a lower resolution 
than print. So, if the text is small, 
sans-serif fonts can be clearer 
to read.
Monospace
Every letter in a monospace (or 
fixed-width) font is the same 
width. (Non-monospace fonts 
have different widths.)
