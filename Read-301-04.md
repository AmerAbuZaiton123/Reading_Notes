# Forms
- HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.


## Controlled Components

-In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`.

-Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.


## The textarea Tag
`<textarea>
  Hello there, this is some text in a text area
</textarea>`

## The select Tag
-In HTML, <select> creates a drop-down list. For example, this HTML creates a drop-down list of flavors:
  
```<select>
   <option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit</option>
   <option value="lime">Lime</option>
   <option selected value="coconut">Coconut</option>
   <option value="mango">Mango</option>
</select>```
  
 ## Why would we use a ternary operator?

First, weâ€™ll take a look at the syntax of a typical `if statement`:
```
if ( condition ) {
  value if true;
} else {
  value if false;
}
```
