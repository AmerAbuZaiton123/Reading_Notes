# Forms
- HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.


## Controlled Components

-In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`.

-Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.


## The textarea Tag
`<textarea>
  Hello there, this is some text in a text area
</textarea>`

## The select Tag
-`In HTML, <select> creates a drop-down list. For example, this HTML creates a drop-down list of flavors:

## select
<select>
   <option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit</option>
   <option value="lime">Lime</option>
   <option selected value="coconut">Coconut</option>
   <option value="mango">Mango</option>
</select>
  
 ## Why would we use a ternary operator?
First, we’ll take a look at the syntax of a typical if statement:
```
if ( condition ) {
  value if true;
} else {
  value if false;
}
```


```
condition ? value if (true) : value if (false)

Here’s what you need to know:

    The condition is what you’re actually testing. The result of your condition should be true or false or at least coerce to either boolean value.
    A ? separates our conditional from our true value. Anything between the ? and the : is what is executed if the condition evaluates to true.
    Finally a : colon. If your condition evaluates to false, any code after the colon is executed.

Example — Driver Age

We’ll take a moment to revisit the initial example in this article:

let person = {
  name: 'tony',
  age: 20,
  driver: null
};person.driver = person.age >=16 ? 'Yes' : 'No';
```
