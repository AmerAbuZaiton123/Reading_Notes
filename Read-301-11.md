## What is OAuth ?
OAuth is open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers  ,services  can  safely allow authenticated access 
## Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.
The simple example of OAuth is when you go to log onto  website   offers one or more opportunite  log on using another website’s/service’s logon. You then click on the button linked
## How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
-The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.
-The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
-The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
-The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).
-If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
-The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
-The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).
-The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
-The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
-The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
-The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.
-OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption. It succeeded with adoption rates where previous attempts failed (for various reasons).
## What is OpenID?
There are a couple of other security technologies that you might hear about in the same context as OAuth, and one of them is OpenID. At a base level, the distinction between the two is simple to grasp. Remember when we said up above that the auth in OAuth stood for authorization, not authentication? Well, OpenID is about authentication: as a commenter on StackOverflow pithily put it: "OpenID is for humans logging into machines, OAuth is for machines logging into machines on behalf of humans."
## What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
uth0 uses the OpenID Connect (OIDC) Protocol and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework to authenticate users and get their authorization to access protected resources. With Auth0, you can easily support different flows in your own applications and APIs without worrying about OIDC/OAuth 2.0 specifications or other technical aspects of authentication and authorization.

We support scenarios for server-side, mobile, desktop, client-side, machine-to-machine, and device applications.
## What is Authorization Code Flow?
ring authentication, mobile and native applications can use the Authorization Code Flow, but they require additional security. Additionally, single-page apps have special challenges. To mitigate these, OAuth 2.0 provides a version of the Authorization Code Flow which makes use of a Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).

## What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
When public clients (e.g., native and single-page applications) request Access Tokens, some additional security concerns are posed that are not mitigated by the Authorization Code Flow alone.
