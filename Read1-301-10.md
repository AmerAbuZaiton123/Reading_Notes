# Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
## What is a call Function ?

 function invocation.

## How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?


-Only one.

##  What does LIFO mean?
* 
When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

### Exampel

What happens here is:
`function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}


## What causes a Stack Overflow?

A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack erro

# JavaScript error messages

## What is a ‘refrence error’?

-This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

## What is a ‘syntax error’?

I know it’s in the name of the errors, but like it says itself, this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.
## What is a ‘range error’?

It is an error that occurs when you give it an invalid length to an array.

## What is a ‘tyep error’?
Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

A point in which JS will stop executing and let you examine JavaScript values when it reaches.
