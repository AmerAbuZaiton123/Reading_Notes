# Html Layout
### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
>CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its 
>own box. This box will either be a block-level
>box or an inline box.
>Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks 
>of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can 
>control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the 
>boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use 
>borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

### Block-level elements
>start on a new line
>Examples include:
>`<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`
### Inline elements
>flow in between 
>surrounding text
>Examples include:
`<img> <b> <i>



## Controlling the Position of Elements`
>CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control 
>the layout of a page: **normal** **flow**, **relative** **positioning**, and **absolute** 
>positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
>property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

### Normal flow
Every block-level element 
appears on a new line

### Relative Positioning
This moves an element from the 
position it would be in normal 
flow,

### Absolute positioning
This positions the element 
in relation to its containing 
element. It is taken out of 
normal flow

### Box offset properties
#### Fixed Positioning 
This is a form of absolute 
positioning that positions 
the element in relation to the 
browser window, as opposed 
to the containing element. 
Elements with fixed positioning 
do not affect the position of 
surrounding elements and they 
do not move when the user 
scrolls up or down the page.

#### Floating Elements
Floating an element allows 
you to take that element out 
of normal flow and position 
it to the far left or right of a 
containing box. The floated 
element becomes a block-level 
element around which other 
content can flow

# Function
### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task,

### Diclaer function
