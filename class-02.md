# TEXT
* how to add markup to the text
> - Structural markup: the elements that you can use to 
    describe both headings and paragraphs
  - Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such 
    as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something 
    you have written is a quotation  
>
### HTML has six "levels" of headings:
<h1> is used for main headings
<h2> is used for subheadings
If there are further sections 
under the subheadings then the 
<h3> element is used, and so 
on..
>

### Paragraphs
> To write paragraphs use p tage and can use demo text by lorem

>
### Bold & Italic
 > can let text bold by b tage and can let text italic by i tage 

 ### Semantic Markup
>
There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the 
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the 
pages â€” they are known as semantic markup

# CSS

### CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements
>
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern 
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule 
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration
This rule indicates that all <p>
elements should be shown in the 
Arial typeface. 
Selectors indicate which 
element the rule applies to. 
The same rule can apply to 
more than one element if you 
separate the element names 
with commas.
Declarations indicate how 
the elements referred to in 
the selector should be styled. 
Declarations are split into two 
parts (a property and a value), 
>and are separated by a colon

### CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed

>This rule indicates that all <h1>, 
<h2> and <h3> elements 
should be shown in the Arial 
typeface, in a yellow color.
Properties indicate the aspects 
of the element you want to 
change. For example, color, font, 
width, height and border.
Values specify the settings 
you want to use for the chosen 
properties. For example, if you 
want to specify a color property 
then the value is the color you 
want the text in these elements 
to be.
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two 
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify 
>several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.


# javascript

 -dot is member operator 
 -(here parameter )

 ## JAVASCRIPT RUNS WHERE IT IS FOUND IN THE HTML
  It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript 
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and 
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 
The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages 
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like 
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). 
If you view the source code of the page in the browser, 
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, 
because the script works with the model of the web 
page that the browser has created.


### how declear varible 

- set varible type (var,let,const)
- after that we set (name for variable)

### how set value for variable 
we set value  by assign  
like 
var name="amer"
we set value by assign 
  

### SWITCH STATEMENTS 
A switch statement starts with a 
variable called the switch value. 
Each case indicates a possible 
value for this variable and the 
code that should run if the 
variable matches that value.
